            <h2>Team Vision</h2>
			<p>Our team project vision is to use our own skills and strengths as well as design thinking principles to create a new and original product that serves as a representation of the “<em>Temperature</em> of the <em>St Lucia</em> Campus”. This can be done by assigning each team member with specific tasks that they are good at and from here dedicating roles.</p>
			<p>For example, in regards to the product deliverables, the web developer of the product website will be <em>Haw</em> as he has had previous experience in website designing. In addition, <em>Nan</em> has also had experience with media and video making and thus she will be in charge of the kick starter. <em>Sze</em>, <em>Craig</em> and <em>Ryan</em> are going to be the assigned researchers and their jobs will be to compile data and analyse the insights and trends within it.</p>
